# Microtsetlin

A minimal implementation of [tsetlin machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508) in python (>3).
Not strictly a library yet, see `train()` for training algorithm.
The jupyter notebook contains a WIP visualisation of the tsetlin state.

Versions
- NNP - no numpy - straight python arrays with some of the randomness removed.
- NR - no randomness - removes all the random calls and replaces with a uniform calls.
